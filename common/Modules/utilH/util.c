/*
 * peicewise linear function algorithm, allows for fast lut implementations
 * 
 * usage: call with any x value and information to y LUT you created to get the linear approximation of the graph inbetween the two nearest matching points
 *      
 * preComputedDerivative tells the interpreter wether you have a third dataset in each row containing the derivative at that point or not    
 *      
 * PWL row-format:
 *   preComputedDerivative=0:
 *      {xValue,yValue}
 *      
 *      - xValue: x coordinate of the point
 *      - yValue: y coordinate of the point
 *   preComputedDerivative=1:
 *      {xValue,yValue,dY/dX}
 *      - x/yValue: as in preComputedDerivative=0
 *      - dY/dX: pre-computed rate of change in between the point and the next one in the list
 *  
 *      NOTE: the list must be sorted by x values in ascending order (x[0] < x[1] < x[2]...)
 *      NOTE: if you need this to be fast, make sure to pre-calculate the derivatives as this saves a division for every conversion
