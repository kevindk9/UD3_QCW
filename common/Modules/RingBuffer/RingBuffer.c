/* thoughts regarding thread safe reading and writing:
 * 
 * in order for a read to be valid we need to make sure that the position read has been written completely before accessing it. The solution: increase the write pointer only after every buffer write operation is done.
 * 
 * same goes for writing. We must ensure that a write doesn't happen if the position we write to might still be read at the time of writing. So we must only to increase the read pointer after the read operation has finished
 * 
 * TODO this is certainly not valid for the shiftOnOverflow addition, verify and fix potential issues
